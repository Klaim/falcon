      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Embedding Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, prepare
      Embedding Works, prepare Scripts, publicly display, publicly perform,
      sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source
      or Object form.

      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution of Work and Derivative Works. You may reproduce and
      distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any
      medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) You must state in the Source Form and in the documentation of
          any Derivative Work the fact that such work is a derivation of
          the Work, and include a copy of the Work in its Source form or
          provide directions on how to obtain a copy of the Work in its
          Source form; and

      (e) The Derivative Works are distributed under the terms of this
          License, or under terms that do not cause infringement of this
          License.

   5. Distribution of Embedding Works and Scripts. You may produce and
      distribute any Embedding Work or Scripts thereof in any medium, in
      Source or Object form, provided You meet the following conditions:

       (a) The Embedding Works and Scripts are distributed under the term
           of this License, or the application of another License is
           explicitly stated in the documentation of the Embedding Works
           and Scripts or included in the Source form of the Embedding
           Works and Scripts; and

       (b) The Embedding Works carry a prominent notice in their
           documentation, or when not applicable, in any place that the
           Users are exposed to, about the fact that the Work is embedded,
           along with a general statement about the task that the Work is
           performing in the Embedding Works; and

       (c) If the Source form of Embedding Works is distributed or made
           available to the Users in any medium and by any means, the
           portions of the Source form that causes the Work to be embedded
           must carry a prominent notice about this fact, along with a general
           statement about the task that the Work is performing in the
           Embedded Works; and

       (d) If the Source form of Scripts is not distributed nor made
           available by any mean to the Users, a prominent notice about the
           fact that the Scripts have been written in the Language must be
           presented in a place which the Users are exposed to.

   6. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement You may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   7. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   8. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   9. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   10.Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of Your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
