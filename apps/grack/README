Grammar Check for Falcon Grammar Definition files.

Falcon "generic parser" standard module provides support for
generic grammar parsing, via a file format called FGD (Falcon
Grammar Definition).

FGD is an EBNF-like grammar that allows for Falcon code snippets
to be used as grammar recognition handlers.

The GRACK application helps to develop FGD files by performing
several formal checks on the generated grammar, and can then
generate an EBNF rendering of it to be included in the 
documentation of a certain software.
