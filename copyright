             The Falcon Programming Language
                http://www.falconpl.org

Falcon is currently distributed under a dual licensing scheme GPL/FPLL.

The GPL licensing scheme is provided to ensure compatibilty with
Open Source and Free Software products. It's a relative strict license
which is not particularly adequate for virtual machine based scripting
languge interpreters and engines, but it can be chosen to develop
pure GPL applications or to favor integration with already
existing GPL embedding applications. 

Falcon 0.9 and following grant the so called "OpenSSL exception to
GPL" were applicable:

 In addition, as a special exception, the author of this
 program gives permission to link the code of its 
 release with the OpenSSL project's "OpenSSL" library (or
 with modified versions of it that use the same license as
 the "OpenSSL" library), and distribute the linked
 executables. You must obey the GNU General Public 
 License in all respects for all of the code used other 
 than "OpenSSL".  If you modify this file, you may extend
 this exception to your version of the file, but you are
 not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so,
 delete this exception statement from your version.


The Falcon Programming Language License is specifically designed
around the concept of an open source scripting language engine.
It grants usability of the covered source in commercial applications,
as it supports applying different and incompatible licenses to
embedding and extension elements, while ensuring the openness of
the core engine and of any work derived directly from it.

Falcon 0.8.10 and followings are released under one of GPLv2+OpenSSL
exception or FPLLv1.1, at your choice.
