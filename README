                             Falcon Feathers

                                  0.9


Falcon feathers are the fundamental, well known modules that are part of the
official Falcon distributions. They are granted to be present in a correct
falcon installation.

Yet, they are handled as a separate project, both for administrative reasons
and to insolate them from the development of the core system, which may be
erratic and cause sudden changes in the interfaces.

Modules admitted in the Feathers are currently:

   * compiler
   * confparser
   * funcext
   * json
   * logging
   * mxml
   * process
   * regex
   * socket
   * threading

In version 0.9.4.2 we added "logging" and in 0.9.4.4 "json".


BUILDING
========

To build the Falcon Feathers, you'll need a well setup Falcon Development
Environment, as specified in the relative document at

   http://old.falconpl.org/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=The+build+environment

The core must be built and installed in the active tree before starting
feathers configuration.

Then,

   cmake .
   make
   make install

should do.
