BUILDING
========

To build the Falcon SDL, you'll need a well setup Falcon Development
Environment, as specified in the relative document at

   http://www.falconpl.org/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=The+build+environment

The core must be built and installed in the active tree before starting
feathers configuration.

Then,

   cmake .
   make
   make install

should do.
