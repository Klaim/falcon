Falcon DBI is the database abstraction layer that is part of the official
Falcon distributions. They are granted to be present in a correct falcon
installation.

Yet, they are handled as a separate project, both for administrative reasons
and to insolate them from the development of the core system, which may be
erratic and cause sudden changes in the interfaces.

Modules admitted in the DBI are currently:

   * sql
   * mysql
   * pgsql
   * sqlite3

BUILDING
========

To build the Falcon DBI, you'll need a well setup Falcon Development
Environment, as specified in the relative document at

   http://www.falconpl.org/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=The+build+environment

The core must be built and installed in the active tree before starting
feathers configuration.

Then,

   cmake .
   make
   make install

should do.
