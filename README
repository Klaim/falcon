                               SDL binding

                                  1.0

  This is the SDL binding module for The Falcon Programming language.


BUILDING
========

To build the Falcon SDL, you'll need a well setup Falcon Development
Environment, as specified in the relative document at

   http://www.falconpl.org/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=The+build+environment

The core must be built and installed in the active tree before starting
feathers configuration.

Then,

   cmake .
   make
   make install

should do.

On MacOSX
=========

SDL On MacOSX uses the Cocoa framework. This requires the SDL-using
applications to be specially built and configured.

Falcon applications using the SDL Module and initializing the video
output should be run with sdl_falcon rather than with falcon.

sdl_falcon is a MacOSX application which sends COCOA messages to SDL.
Otherwise, it is a completely normal falcon interpreter (it is always
kept in sync with the official Falcon command line tool).

This application is built and installed exclusively on MacOSX.
