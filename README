                              Falcon DBI

                                  0.9.2


Falcon DBI is the database abstraction layer that is part of the official
Falcon distributions. They are granted to be present in a correct falcon
installation.

Yet, they are handled as a separate project, both for administrative reasons
and to insolate them from the development of the core system, which may be
erratic and cause sudden changes in the interfaces.

Modules admitted in the DBI are currently:

   * sql
   * mysql
   * pgsql
   * sqlite3

BUILDING
========

To build the Falcon DBI module, you just need to have Falcon
development files (or a complete Falcon development environment)
setup on your machine.

Then,

   cmake .
   make
   make install

should do.
