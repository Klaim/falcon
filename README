                               SDL binding

                                  1.0

  This is the SDL binding module for The Falcon Programming language.
Binary downloads, documentation, support and so on is available through
the following link:

BUILDING
========

  To build the Falcon SDL, you'll need a well setup Falcon Development
Environment, as specified in the relative document at

   http://www.falconpl.org/wiki/tiki-index.php?page=The+build+environment

  Once the Core is in place, you should be sure you have installed and 
configured all the SDL libraries needed for this module:

   - SDL base
   - SDL_ttf
   - SDL_mixer
   - SDL_image

  If you're on linux, chances are that you will have all them pre-installed.
However you will very probably have to install the relative development 
packages.

  You may obtain the libraries in binary (with headers) and source format from

   http://www.libsdl.com


On MS-WINDOWS
=============

  On the Falcon site, the SDL project area stores a pre-configured set of
the official SDL libraries and development support files that you can copy
and install. on the SDL_DEV directory under this one.

  The file contains an sdl_falpb.bat configurator that can be used in place
of falpb to find all the SDL dependency and create the development tree.

  The sdl_falpb.bat script can be used also as a reference on how to direct
the cmake build system to find SDL libraries you may have compiled and
installed elsewhere.



On MacOSX
=========

  SDL On MacOSX uses the Cocoa framework. This requires the SDL-using
applications to be specially built and configured.

  First, you should install the SDL frameworks provided by SDL at the
home site we indicated above. 

  Falcon applications using the SDL Module and initializing the video
output should be run with sdl_falcon rather than with falcon.

  sdl_falcon is a MacOSX application which sends COCOA messages to SDL.
Otherwise, it is a completely normal falcon interpreter (it is always
kept in sync with the official Falcon command line tool).

  This application is built and installed exclusively on MacOSX.
