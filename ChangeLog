SDL (0.9.2)
   * fxied: WaitEvent() caused a too tight loop in the VM, wasting 
            100% cpu.
   * fixed: WaitEvent() always returned to itself, even in case of quit,
            instead returning to the caller after a single message was 
            processed.
   * Fixed: SDLColor (full class reflection was drawn but left incomplete).

SDL (0.9)
   * Added support for SDL_image and SDL_mixer
