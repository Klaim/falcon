SDL (0.9.2.1)
   * fxied: TTF Function wasn't getting colors with b == 0.
   * fixed: Memleak (debug code in destructor...)
   * fixed: UpdateRect wasn't working when the parameter was an SDLRect
   * fixed: SDLRect was crashing if not receiving 4 parameters.
   * fixed: SDL.PushUserEvent didn't zero optional data if it wasn't passed.

SDL (0.9.2)
   * fxied: WaitEvent() caused a too tight loop in the VM, wasting 
            100% cpu.
   * fixed: WaitEvent() always returned to itself, even in case of quit,
            instead returning to the caller after a single message was 
            processed.
   * Fixed: SDLColor (full class reflection was drawn but left incomplete).

SDL (0.9)
   * Added support for SDL_image and SDL_mixer
