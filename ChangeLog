Falcon (0.9.1.9)
  * fixed: using more modern throw instead of the obsolete raise() functions
           in many points.
  * fixed: "find" method in strings was erroneusly named "strFind".
  * minor: Added brigade() ETA function.
  * fixed: Directory class wasn't masked; as a result, using it caused crash.
           As a fix, we removed DirectoryOpen function and allowed Directory
           constructor to work as previously done by DirectoryOpen.
  * added: Directory.descend (it's meant to be a reminder for a complete
           do() framework).
  * fixed: List.first() wasn't returning a fully prepared iterator.
  * fixed: Oob wasn't working properly on immediate strings.
  * fixed: isoob() was returning 0 or 1 instead or false/true.
  * fixed: PostMessage() wasn't forwarding errors to the main VM loop in case
           of asynchronous message posting.
  * fixed: More correct error messages in case of problems loading submodules.
  * added: Method wordSize() to MemBuf metaclass.
  * fixed: Particular errors in class declaration may have caused error detection
           to segfault.
  * fixed: Array back-mark to its table did not deep-mark its data; as a result,
           the table got marked with the current generation and skipped its mark
           processing loop as a standard object. This exposes the need to
           rationalize and simplify the Garbage/mark Object/gcMark interface.
  * fixed: LiveModule::detach() was nilling the original (imported) values
           rather than the local objects.
  * fixed: fself wasn't working in init blocks.
  * fixed: Error class couldn't be inherited from scripts.
  * fixed: For/in loops with negative step exited immediately when start == stop
  * added: Added String.startsWith, String.endsWith, strStartWith(), strEndWith()


Falcon (0.9.1.8)
  * fixed: faltest didn't output help text when called with -h/-?
  * fixed: Operator overriding in blessed dictionaries had many issues.
  * fixed: prefix inc/dec operator overriding now returns what is returned
           by the overriding function (formerly, it returned the item itself).
  * fixed: StringStream wasn't respecting stream copy semantic (copy shell,
           respect underlying stream). As a result, it couldn't be used to
           communicate across threads.
  * minor: StringStream is now interlocked; it can be proficiently used as
           an interthread safe raw data exchange device.
  * fixed: Obviating the need for ";" in function declared inside
           dictionaries.
  * minor: Falcon command line doesn't require full module generation to generate
           the debug grammar tree module.
  * major: Now allowing circular references in module loads.
  * fixed: Unpack is now working in every situation (and generally, more
           efficiently).
  * fixed: Didn't set correctly the default .ftt extension for -y options, and
           caused the original file to be overwritten.
  * fixed: Issues on multilanguage and internationalization.
  * minor: Added search path to the engine and to all the items involved into
           compilation. Also, added vmSearchPath() script function to allow
           scripts to get the path as set by the application.
  * fixed: Format wasn't correctly parsing ":0" (zero-length variable length
           integer formatting).
  * fixed: Escapes at the beginning of multiline double-quote strings were lost.
  * fixed: Possible reaping of table pages by an execessive GC usage.

Falcon (0.9.1.6)
  * fixed: In loop statement, continue looped from the top skipping the
           loop condition (if it was present).
  * fixed: Function "any" was STILL returning 0 instead of false.
  * major: Added method ptr() to FBOM and various metaclasses.
  * major: Added explicit character size scaling and c-zation of
           Falcon::Strings.
  * fixed: Repeated assert() may have crashed depending on the stack
           status.
  * fixed: Due to faulty method equality check, method unsubscription
           was failing.
  * minor: Added subscription priority parameter.
  * fixed: getAssert() didn't get the correct default parameter when
           the required slot wasn't found, and VMSlot.getAssert wasn't parsing
           correctly its parameters.
  * fixed: MessageError wasn't exported to the Core module.
  * minor: Added CoreSlot.name() method.
  * fixed: VMSlot wasn't properly setting the user data, so for/in didn't
           know it was a sequence.
  * minor: Added first() and last() methods to VMSlot to allow iterators
           to work.
  * fixed: Detach() sequence was just a draft, and didn't actually free
           app-side data.
  * fixed: Respecting ThreadParams settings in POSIX thread creation.
  * fixed: Dind't correctly generate InterruptedError on VM interruption
           requests.
  * fixed: Function parameters were still hard-limited to 255. Now they
           are limited to uint32 (2^32).
  * fixed: std I/O blocked on Win7 (inheritance rights on DuplicateHandle).
  * fixed: crash in call__ callback for functors.
  * fixed: static initializer in classes didn't use standard definition of
           const_atom.
  * fixed: Secured deserialization on almost-last item.
  * major: Added support for operator overloading in poop, and Dictionary.set()
           /dictSet() to be able to bypass [] overloading if needed.
  * fixed: Interoperability of FAM and serialization across endianity.
  * fixed: Module unloading is now secure.
  * minor: Added readURI and writeURI functions.

Falcon (0.9.1.4)
  * fixed: As now files and modules loads are URIs, and URI decoding was
           strict, modules with international names could not be loaded
           unless the name was previously URI escaped.
  * minor: Now it's possible to prevent parsing (un-escaping) from URI
           constructor.
  * minor: Fixed error failed DLL load error report string in Windows.
  * fixed: Now correctly importing symbols from modules named with
           strings.

Falcon (0.9.1.2)
  * fixed: Correct parsing of octal number (0 and 7 was out...)
  * fixed: Crash with statements == just numbers, and allowing interactive
           compiler to parse non-stand alone expressions and evaluate them.
  * fixed: A leftover from version 0.8.14 caused tables not to properly mark
           their contents on garbage collection.
  * fixed: More flexible int() and numeric() functions (thanks Kless).
  * minor: Added functions vmModuleName, vmModulePath and vmRelativePath to
           help solving dynamic dependencies.
  * fixed: [DANGER]: Fixed missing GC marking of items in frame stacks (mainly
           self and binding registers). This was in since 0.8.0; it was less
           evident because 0.8 had sender which cached the last minus one
           self objects, saving at least the previous caller, and it was
           unlikely that the nth-2 caller wasn't cached somewhere else in the
           VM.
  * fixed: include() was using a cached pointer variable to create the error
           message; the VM stack may have been (usually is) dirtied, so the
           pointer was invalidated. This could have caused random crashes
           and errors in reporting the failing module name.
  * fixed: Finetuned module loader error reporting (now it indicates the module
           whose dependency wasn't found).
  * fixed: Some functional selectors (any & c) still returned 0 on false and 1
           on true.
  * minor: String.merge() now accepts only an array as parameters, and works
           as String.join() does with its parameters.
  * fixed: Const atoms din't include negative numbers (i.e. negative numbers
           couldn't be used in enum declarations).
  * fixed: Reporting a consistent error when aliasing different modules to the
           same namespace.
  * fxied: Now the VM correctly lets imported undefined symbols not being
           part of namespaces to generate a proper error.

Falcon (0.9.1)
  * fixed: String-blocks closed with " alone on a line werent' recognized.
  * fixed: Octal numbers weren't properly scanned.
  * added: Support for binary numbers (0b..., "\B...") and octal with 0c...
           and numeric neuter separator "_".
  * fixed: (possible) race condition in VM destruction and re-creation and GC
           VM marking.
  * fixed: Long existing latent bug in Lists and iterators: if the GC destroyed
           the list, the iterators may still refer to it.
  * fixed: Some latent problem in deep marking of object/classes.
  * major: Now lazy unload of modules on-the-fly is supported (some wip)
  * fixed: Missing rethrow at frame return (errors inside second level
           callItem()).
  * fixed: Error reporting from inner compilations (include etc).
  * fixed: Line number of errors in FTDs.
  * fixed: Stream::readString exchanged a success for an error...
  * fixed: Syntax errors in global statements caused the compiler to crash.
  * fixed: Indirect operator didn't methodize callable properties.
  * fixed: Buffered streams returned an error on EOF instead of 0.
  * fixed: Fixed date "%m" field in to-string.
  * fixed: Small memory leak in compiler re-initialization.
  * fixed: Loading of deep paths (due to 0.9)
  * fixed: Some short-to-wide chars transformation code on buffered strings
           (latent from 0.8).
  * fixed: Path class was working a bit randomly.
  * fixed: FileStat class wasn't correctly caching the mtime member.
  * major: Added detection of statements without effect (or with partial effect)
           at compile time; useful to detect "str1"\n"str2" left from 0.8.x
  * fixed: Errors in "loop" definitions may have caused a segfault.
  * fixed: Seek from current position wasn't working in buffered streams.
  * fixed: Better to always fill the error backtrace, for now.
  * fixed: Ops, totally forgot to add the -L load path in falcon exe.
  * fixed: Re-enabled copy-on-assign on strings; too dangerous without.
  * fixed: As Falcon didn't destroy the VM at end, items where not propery finalized.
  * fixed: Rare crash on static string live module owner marking. This poses a question
           on validity of current marking algorithm for live string (to be checked out).
  * fixed: Stream.readAvaliable() may have reported spurious false positive on UNIces.
  * fixed: Callback frame termination handler was not set if there was just one frame
           the stack.
  * major: It is now possible to launch symbols as coroutines without a FORK opcode.
  * fixed: Since 0.8.0, VMachine::callReturn restored caller exit value in case of
           context termination. This caused spurious wakeups and signal consumptions
           in coroutine semaphores, as the return value of the wait() function must
           be mangled from inside the sleeping context, and may be applied when a
           context dies. As 0.9 uses small coroutines (dying often) to send messages,
           the effect was dramatically visible.

Falcon (0.9)
  * major: Removed "sender" from grammar.
  * fixed: Array bindings was not correctly accounted by the Garbage
           Collector.
  * minor: Methods can now be called directly also on numbers.
  * minor: Removed VMachine::compareItems; using inbound item
           comparators.
  * minor: Fallc now saves in UTF-8 in merge mode.
  * major: Removed "pass" and "pass/in" statements.
  * minor: Removed "itemCopy()" function (changed into clone() methodic FBOM).
  * minor: Renamed FBom method into typeId (type is too useful as property name for users).
  * minor: Revamped and methodized strFront and strBack (String.front()/String.back()).
  * major: Removed attributes.
  * major: Added class VMSlot, broadcast, consume, assert, retract, register and unregister
           message oriented functions.
  * major: Revamped Engine Message and Error system; now, they are centralized in
           eng_messages.h, where new generic messages and errors can be simply added.
  * minor: The engine string table is now expoerted as for any module and can be
           internationalized.
  * fixed: String Copy constructor didn't set export to false.
  * minor: -L option in falcon and falrun excluded automatically the system default path.
  * major: VFS in loading modules implemented.
  * major: Removed the obsolete ErrorHandler mechanism and using C++ exceptions.
  * minor: MemBuf now provides an interface with Java NIO Buffer semantics.
  * minor: Removed factory function FileReadStats(); now the constructor in FileStats()
           does everything.
  * minor: Method FileStat.readStats is renamed as FileStat.read
  * minor: Changed the order of parameters in RTL serialize() function (first the item,
           then the stream).
  * minor: Swapped wildcard and string parameters in strWilcardMatch.
  * minor: Added String.join method.
  * major: Methodized all Item API related functions.
  * minor: Removed now useless functions arrayCopy, arrayFilter and arrayMap.
  * minor: Removed indirect function (call, callMethod, marshal*), as they are now easily
           available through eval() and languge operators.
  * minor: Removed now useless function dictInsert().
  * minor: Added methodic function strFill() / String.fill().
  * minor: Added methodic function arrayFill() / Array.fill().
  * minor: Added methodic function dictFill() / Dictionary.fill().
  * major: Standard streams and local filesystem VFS providers are now
           serving buffered streams.
  * minor: Added getBuffering()/setBuffering() methods to Stream.
  * fixed: Transcoding control (it is now possible to change
           transcoders more than once).
  * minor: Added grab(), grabLine() and grabText() methods to streams. The
           older functions cannot return newly allocated buffers anymore.
  * minor: read/write functions on streams now can take advantage of NIO
           MemBuf interface.
  * fixed: abs() was mapped to fract(!)
  * major: Assignment does not causes strings to be automatically copied
           anymore. Automatic copy is performed on modify (if the string
           is static), and in deep copies of containers. Modify of non-static
           string doesn't cause the strings to be copied (explicit .clone() is
           required). So, a = "...", b = a, b and a will be disconnected
           when one is modified, while a = strMerge(...), b = a, b and a would
           reflect each other changes. This is a bit hybrid, but consequences
           are hardly visible. The point is that if you want a mutable string
           to be different, use an explicit .clone(), and if you want just
           read-only strings use "...".
  * major: New GC support: Added singleton GC with static members usedMem,
           aliveMem, items, th_normal th_active and with static functions
           enable() and perform(), reflecting the new engine wide GC. The
           old functions gcEnable, gcSetThreshold, gcPerform, gcSetTimeout,
           gcGetParams are removed.
  * major: Introduced parametric evaluation, and oob(0/1) now works at
           VMachine::functionalEval() level. Parametric eval is done by
           setting &N where N 1..parmCount() to the nth parameter.
  * minor: Removed xtimes() and empowered times(). Also, times() is now
           methodic for Integers and Ranges. Times passes the loop number
           via parametric evaluation (&1).
  * minor: Added ETA methods upto() and downto() for Integer metaclass.
  * major: Added { param => body } fast nameless function declaration.
  * major: Binary module logical names are resolved adding _fm to the
           searched module name. In example, "load module" searches for
           module_fm.dll. Fam/fal/ftd file resolution is unchanged.
  * major: The loop statement now supports a conditional ending.
           The end keyword of the loop statement block can be followed by
           an expression; the loop terminates when the condition is true
           (same as repeat/until).
  * fixed: Naming two times a closed variable in closures caused the
           parameter resolution order to be messed up.
  * major: Removed 'lambda' keyword. Use {=>} instead.
  * major: Added 'fself' keyword referring to the current symbol being
           executed. Won't work with methods for now.
  * minor: Added 'getProperty' and 'setProperty' methods to deep items
           meta-classes.
  * minor: Added 'name' and 'caller' methods to function metaclass.
  * fixed: Fixed crash when inserting just single constants in interactive
           compiler.
  * major: Removed dot-quoted strings (.")
  * major: Removed automatic joining of adjiacent double quoted string.
           Now, "a" "b" are two separated tokens.
  * minor: Added compiletime parsing of + and * operators on strings. This
           means that it is possible to join strings at compile time via
           "a" + "b"
  * minor: Binary operators can accept an optional EOL after them. A line can
           terminate with a + and the expression can continue on the next
           line without a \ to join them.
  * major: Literal strings now never escape with a \. "\" is always
           considered just a \; to add a single quote in a literal (single
           quoted) string, write a single quote twice ('').
  * major: Multiline strings are now initiated with a single open " or '
           followed by an EOL. They terminate to the matching " or ', and
           the context coninues to the end of the terminator line.
           Double-quoted strings are non-literal, and compress new line and
           leading whitespace characters into a single space, while single
           quoted strings are literal, and insert into the string any space
           and line break in the source. This means that double quoted
           strings can be used to break a long string across multiple lines
           and arbitrarily indented, while single quoted strings define a
           verbatim block.


Falcon (0.8.14)
  * fixed: Now asObject() raises an error if the item is not an object;
           this grant safety for methods that are not considered static.
  * fixed: Pow function (possibly to be deleted) was taking the first
           argument twice.
  * fixed: transcodeTo/transcodeFrom was actually not published correctly
           by the core module.
  * fixed: Expressions in "from" clauses (init expressions) may not resolve
           correctly symbols if the body of the object or class was empty.
           This caused assert and crash if generating expressions with symbols
           during "from" clauses of otherwise bodyless objects and classes.
  * fixed: Relevant warnings in array LDV/range (check order priority).
  * fixed: Relevant warnings symbol table generation (check order priority).
  * fixed: Generating a range from bogus values didn't raise a type error.
  * fixed: Import from module used "=" instead of "as" (leftover).
  * added: Reintroduced for/to grammar, (step now substituted by "," ),
           actually a candy grammar for for/in.
  * added: OOB opcode which manages out of band items.
  * added: OOB operators: ^+ (oob), ^- (deoob), ^? (isoob), ^! (invert oob status)
  * minor: Removed function inspectShort() and secured/empowered inspect().
  * minor: Added parameter defItem to arrayBuffer to "replicate items in arrays".
  * fixed: Range change in arrays was taking one item too much.
  * fixed: Exotic range applications (as substitutions in reverse ranges with
           negative indices) wasn't working as expected. Part of it was due to
           missing or approximative definition, part to plain errors. Now the
           semantic of ranged access is defined and enforced through all the
           operators and RTL functions.
  * minor: VMachine::launch() is now necessary to start executing the main script
           even if launchAtLink() is true at link time. In other words,
           launchAtLink() controls only the execution of the main symbol in the
           non-main scripts.
  * minor: falrun now returns 255 on vm error.


Falcon (0.8.12)
  * major: Support for class-driven full reflection and 0-space contstant/reflected
      classes.
  * major: Changes to FileStat interface:
      - FileStat.type becomes FileStat.ftype
      - FILE_TYPE_* constants are now static properties of FileStat.
  * major: Added support for module dynamic symbol creation on script request.
  * major: Added import [sym1, sym2, ... symN] from Module grammar.
  * fixed: Assigments shouldn't define symbols accessed or called.
  * fixed: continue dropping wasn't working for last elements in dictionaries.
  * minor: Now it is possible to alter static properties by their class name.
  * fixed: Some type error in VM should have been catchable, but was raised hard.
  * fixed: The compiler didn't always add module strings as symbol names.
  * fixed: Broadcast may have broadcast double in case of a single receiver not
            returning true.
  * minor: Added attributeByName function.
  * major: RTL module is removed (merged with core).
  * major: Now main code of modules is always executed. Added vmIsMain() function
           in core to be able to check if the current module is meant as main module
           or not.
  * minor: Added testAttribute() function to test for attributes.
  * major: Added interactive mode to Falcon command line tool.
  * minor: Option -D (set directive) has been moved to -d;
           -D sets compile time constants.
  * major: Macro and Meta compilation added. The escapes \[ and \] perform meta
           compilation, and the macro keyword and \\ escapes are candy grammar
           for macro compilation.
  * major: Added support for late binding.
  * major: Added local/late binding in functional constructs.
  * major: Added dynamic symbol resolution for arrays.
  * bufix: deadlocks at coroutine end when some context was waiting
           endless was not detected.
  * minor: added ETA functions let (assign) and lbind (make late binding).
  * minor: ',' can now be optionally used in .[] decl.
  * fixed: dolist wasn't breaking on oob(nil), but on just false.
  * major: Forward binding implemented. Currently used to resolve
           named parameter function calls.
  * minor: include() function added to Core module allowing dynamic module
           loading directly from base programs.
  * minor: added vmFalconPath() informative function.
  * major: Addition and self addition on strings now forces conversion of the
           target object into a string. I.e. "H" + 1 => "H1". Integer UNICODE
           operations are now delegated to the "*" and "*=" operators. So,
           "Hello" * 32 + "World" => "Hello World" and "H" *= 65 => "HA".
  * fixed: URI.encode() was actually decoding.
  * minor: Introduced xtimes() function which works like times(), but evaluates
           all the items in sequence instead of just running them.
  * major: Added TABULAR PROGRAMMING:
           - Added Item type "TabMethod" to store methods for arrays/tables
           - Self item is now propagated to functions called inside arrays.
           - Table column can now be used as properties of arrays inside the tables.
  * fixed: Assignments to properties and vector didn't propagate the assignand
            value.
  * fixed: Fixed compilation on Darwin.
  * fixed: Fixed missed mark of some deep item during GC (may have caused random
            crashes).
  * major: Added the concept of "blessed dictionary" that is seen as an instance.
  * minor: Much more sensible policy of EOL removal in FTD escapes.
  * minor: Added function valof returning the value of a variable or the return value
           of a callable item.
  * major: Added import aliasing.
  * major: Inheritance initialization parameter can now be any expression.
  * fixed: Disregarding old bytecode .fam files didn't work correctly.
  * minor: Added the eval unary prefix operator, first of cap-special operators: "^*"
           works a bit like eval() function, but much more efficient, expecially in
           the fast path.

Falcon (0.8.10)
  * minor: Now classes can be stored in object properties and called to get
      an instance.
  * bugfix: Indirect operator wasn't peeking the global table after having
      failed in searching the local table.
  * bugfix: When a "module provider" was given to runtime, test for already
      existing modules was always positive.
  * bugfix: fixed ftd line count, export/load directives and reenabled \n
      after a "?>"
  * minor: Added numeric() function to core
  * major: Removed forall and added formiddle which runs after every element
      except the last one (even if "forlast" isn't provided).
  * minor: dirMake() has now an extra parameter; if provided and true, the
      function works as mkdir -p; creates the whole heirarcy, and succeeds
      also if the directory is already present.
  * major: added boolean type. Now, true/false are special compilator tokens
      which generate a boolean item. Every VM check results in a boolean
      item being returned.
  * bugfix: Falcon binary didn't return the VM exit code to the shell.
  * minor: Load now supports ".module" notation to load sibling modules.
  * major: Added import directive for explicit symbol import.
  * bugfix: Fixed deep user data GC marking in methods and classmethods.
  * bugfix: Parameters in FBOM function calls was not removed from stack.
  * minor: It is now possible to call functions stored in classes; class functions
      not referencing "self" can be safely called this way, which makes them "static".
  * bugfix: Timestamp.distance() was returning a random value instead of nil.
  * Minor: Added Path reflexive class to RTL.
  * Minor: Added URI reflexive class to RTL.
  * Major: Added MemBuf type and relative support.
  * Minor: Added functions strToMemBuf and strFromMemBuf in RTL
  * Minor: Added MemBuf support for Stream.read(), Stream.write(), transcodeTo() and transcodeFrom().
  * Minor: Added start parameter to Stream.write()
  * Bugfix: size parameter was not correctly used in Stream.write()
  * Minor: Added internal SharedUserData class which can be used for data shared among many
           objects.
  * Minor: Added inspectShort() function that provides a more compact inspect().
  * Bugfix: Switches couldn't accept negative numbers.
  * Major: Now "=" always assigns, and "==" is used for comparisons.

           readAvailable & writeAvailable have been instrumented. Interruption will raise
           an InterruptedError, can be catched and operations can be resumed.
  * Minor: RangeError renamed into AccessError.
  * Major: Added broadcast replies (returning from broadcast with an OOB item).
  * Minor: Added function vmSystemType() to access underlying target compilation system.

		   for/in loop.
  * Minor: Added pluggable support for multithreading locking scheme and atomic operation
           providers (rudimental, but working).
  * Minor: Added directive "version"=number (0x[VVV]VMMmm) and the function vmModuleVersionInfo()
           to store and access script and .fam version informations.

           (This is because we need some of those symbols for other things in the next releases).
  * Bugfix: strFind and strBackFind didn't work correctly and may crash when receiving wrong values.
  * Major: Provided FAL_MODSTR macro (family) to create module specific string tables.

Falcon (0.8.8)
  * bugfix: TRAV opcode may destroy its parameters while setting first loop
      on rare conditions. Fixed.
  * major: VM now has a map of modules and global variables instead of two
      parallel arrays. This allows arbitrary module unlinking.
  * major: Item size is now 16 bytes. This allow space for stepped ranges.
  * major: Added WKS/WKI (Well Known Symbols/Items) system to obviate the need
      to share global items with scripts and create failsafe instances of
      classes.
  * bugfix: Fixed TimeStamp distance algorithm.
  * minor: List initialization is now possible also with non-atomic symbols.
  * bugfix: Precision in printing default flotaing point number was 6; now is

  * minor: Added strWildcardMatch in RTL for simle *.*-like wildcard matching.
  * minor: Added ETA function firstOf() that retruns the first non-false parameter.
  * bugfix: When having more than one context, each stack had a different
      treshold, possibly causing some of the stacks to crash on realloc.
  * bugfix: Path of the offending module was not shown when reporting compiler errors.
  * major: Load directive can now handle dot modules "a.b"
  * bugfix: ModLoader::addSearchPath didn't locally bufferize the path, and this may
            have caused problems with incoming fixed strings.

Falcon (0.8.6)
  * bugfix: incorrect format of 0.x floating point numbers.

      fp number cannot be represented in an int64.
  * minor: loop statement now accepts a statement on the same line for
      candy grammar.
  * minor: added arrayHead function in rtl.
  * minor: strHead, strHeadTrim, strTail, strTailFind have been renamed

  * bugfix: One line for/in statement COLON rule caused crash.
  * minor: Changed "<" fast print into ">>".
  * bugfix: In case of callitem() from toplevel, errors were not managed correctly.
  * bugfix: Generic array resize (to smaller size) was wrong, and caused VM stack
            corruption when big arrays and recursions were performed.
  * minor: the "_" prefix for symbols is now used for private usage in classes.
  * bugfix: Lexer didn't recognize unclosed contexts at end of file.
  * major: Added dot-square array declaration, and better management of contexts
           /eol in array/list declarations.
  * major: Added compiler directive support. Now "def" wokrs on directive.

Falcon (0.8.4)

    through variable = function(...) ... end  (which was the most common
    pattern for the old usage of lambda expressions
  * major: Lambda expression grammar is much simplified, and they allow only one
    expression as body.
  * major: Added .ftd (falcon template document) file type. It's a outer-escaped
    document (php/asp like) where unescaped literal code and escaped code
    can be seamlessly merged.
  * bugfix: Linear dictionary didn't break search loop in case of VM error.
  * bugfix: VM cleared register A when comparing items. This caused weird
    errors in dictionaries when the objects overloaded compare().
  * bugfix: Fixed try/catch sequences across internal frames
  * improvement: ^^^this also allowed to remove the ugly trypos structure.

    iff, cascade functions for minimal functional support.
  * major: callable arrays for deferred calls and functional support.
  * bugfix: AutoCString and AutoWString may convert incrrectly due to sign mismsatch
    in the return value of String::toCString()/String::toWString(). Fixed (and returing
    uint32).

  * in Error, added a method to stringize only the error header.
  * Fixed ROStream destruction sequence.
  * Fixed GetSystemEncoding (caused falcon cmdline to fail recognize default encodings)
  * Added ideographic space to whitespaces and ideographic quotes to string quotes.
  * Fixed some docs.

Falcon (0.8.2)
  * String::toCString now returns immediately if space is too short.
  * String::toWString now returns size of converted string or -1 on error.
  * AutoCString and AutoWString classes were not correctly exported in Windows.
  * Fassert.h didn't compile under MINGW.
  * Now switch on objects working in every case (including compare() overload)
  * Now operators - and -= remove element(s) from arrays and dictionaries
  * More rational and elegant class interface for garbage collection objects.

Falcon (0.8.1)
  * Fixed bug in VM allocation of temporary vardef that caused
    crash when using special memory allocator.
  * Added option -M to faltest to check for memory leaks
  * Added option -C to falcon to check for memory leaks
  * Removed memory leaks in some VM oprations, in maps, in compiler
    tree destruction, module and symbol destruction and many more.
  * Fixed timestamp method compare() that didn't allow for comparation
    against other types.
  * TimeStamp.toString() created a string too wide by one.
  * Empty loops always generate code. Optimization is to be performed
    by the (still unwritten) optimizer.
  * stdOut() &c now return a system-transcoded stream. To obtain a
    raw stream, use stdOutRaw() etc.
  * Regex.replaceAll() was broken in case of multiple submatches.
  * ProcessHandler last error was not zeroed in creation, causing random
    false negatives (process created ok, but reported error).
  * samples/procLoad.fal updated with correct Error class structure
  * Updated docs.
  * Added BOM serialization and item level cloning.
  * Added cloning support for streams.
  * Added cloning support for timestamps.
  * Items containing objects and classe were not evaluated as true; fixed
  * Added AutoCString and AutoWString class helpers for eaiser conversion
    of falcon items and strings to POD C data.
  * The Falcon::core::sleep function was correctly resolved when the application
    linked against Falcon .so in linux, but when it was loaded indirectly, in
    example, as a cascade load some app's plugin using falcon, it was resolved to the
    system sleep() instead!!!! --- so it has been renamed to Falcon::core::_f_sleep().
  * Fixed VM stack push (GenericVector couldn't push to themselves).
  * Fixed VM context rotation for coroutines managed outside plugins.

Falcon (0.8)

  * Prepared complete Debian packaging and fixed build issues.
  * Starting massive development.
