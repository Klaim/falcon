Feathers (0.9.1.1)
  * fixed: In MXML, removed promotion of data nodes when there are
           other sibling nodes.

Feathers (0.9.1)
  * major: Ported to Falcon 0.9
  * minor: Added split() method to Regex.
  * minor: Added subst() method to Regex (to be thougly tested).
           
Feathers (0.8.14.2)
  * minor: Added pread function to process module.

Feathers (0.8.12)
  * bugfix: Double inheritance in MXML::Document may have caused some compilers
            to mess up the virtual table. Fixed (using a carrier).
  * major: The compiler link mode is now "private".
  * minor: Returning true or false from Regex.match() instead of 0/1.
  * major: Added funcext (Functional extension functions) module
	   containing comparation functional operators and "at" accessor
	   function.
  * bugfix: ZLib wasn't raising a correct error (ZLibError was declared
            as ZlibError); this caused a dynlink error in the VM on
            zlib errors.
  * bugfix: Zlib was not correctly extending the decompression buffer if
            the initial extimate wasn't correct.

Feathers (0.8.10)
  * minor: Added load directive support for loadXXX on reflexive compiler.
  * bugfix: Confparser didn't read 1 character long values.
  * Major: Added MXML module
  * bugfix: REGEX module was taking locally stored PCRE headers even when
            compilation was required against system PCRE.
  * bugfix: Pattern was not compiled with  UTF8 support when the string
            hadn't high UNICODE characters; I.e. matching "." against a
            Japanese character didn't work unless the pattern had some
            Japanese characters too.
  * minor: REGEX using now PCRE 7.6
  * minor: Sockets and partially process compliant with interruption protocol
  * bugfix: Compiler class wasn't correctly reflecting user-data.
  * major: Renamed Process.close into Process.terminate, and changed its semantics;
           Now it doesn't wait anymore for the process to be complete, it is
           necessary to wait through Process.Value().
  * minor: Added method addFalconPath() to the compiler.
  * minor: Added support for language files with property Compiler.language
  * bugfix: Regex module was not correctly checking 8bit only utf-8 sequences.
  * minor: Added compressText and uncompressText to ZLib; compress/uncompress now
           work with membufs and are more adequate to handle binary data.

Feathers (0.8.8)
  * Major: It is now possible to unload arbitrary modules.
  * Major: Added zlib module.
  * Minor: Using WKS/WKI.
  * Minor: Added method "getMultuple()" to configParser to always get a vector
  * Minor: ConfigParser now raises an IoError when having I/O problems.
  * Minor: Now ConfigParser.getCategory() strip names of the category part if the
           category key ends with "*".

Feathers (0.8.6)
  * Bugfix: Process crashed if initialized with a single string.
  * Minor: Added setDirective() to compiler module.

Feathers (0.8.4)
  * Fixed compilation and build settings with MINGW
  * Added compileTemplate and detectTemplate properties to the compiler
    class (reflecting FlcLoader updates)
