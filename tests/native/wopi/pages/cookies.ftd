<h1>Cookies test</h1>
<p>This test checks for cookie usage allwoing to perform an emulated login/logout sequence.
   Also, a cookie with a counter value is stored on the client to count for how many
   times this page has been loaded.
   Other than that, a cookie with arbitrary data is created (by default, using wide-string
   characters).</p>
<p>The user is "master" and the password is "1234". You will need to click on the "reload" link below
to see the international cookie.</p>

   <p>Welcome, <?= user ?></p>
   <p>You have been around <?= times_around ?> times.</p>
   <? if "international" in Request.cookies and Request.cookies["international"] ?>
      <p>You have the international cookie: <?= Request.cookies["international"] ?></p>
