This directory contains the main CORE regression tests.

The scripts here are not stand-alone, and can't be normally
called with "falcon", as they integrate with some utility
provided by "faltest".

A complete and working installation of falcon can be tested
by entering in this directory and launching "faltest" from
the command line.

If the bottom line reports an error, then something is
broken. The faltest manual in the "Command Line Tools"
guide (available with "man faltest" on Linux and
downloadable from http://falconpl.org) illustrates how
to use faltest to have more accurate error reports.

In case of this preliminary test failing, please send
a complete report generated with "faltest -v" applied
on the failing tests to the Committe through our
"contacts" page at
