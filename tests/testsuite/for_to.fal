/****************************************************************************
* Falcon test suite
*
*
* ID: 16a
* Category: loops
* Subcategory: for
* Short: For/to
* Description:
*  For/to is in Falcon back again since 0.8.14. It is just a candy
*  grammar for a standard for/in loop ending at the final element,
*  inclusive. So, we'll do some very basic working tests.
