/****************************************************************************
* Falcon test suite
*
*
* ID: 1a
* Category: basic
* Subcategory: conditionals
* Short: Minimal conditionals
* Description:
*  The tests in "basic" category are mandatory, as they test minimal
*  functionality that falcon scripts must support to test for themselves
*  to be right.
*
*  Testsuite scripts will only use non-complex checks to evaluate the
*  status of a script, so conditionals on basic expressions must be
*  safe.
*
*  This is the minimal test that must be passed, along with the smoke test,
*  to grant the validity of all the other tests.
