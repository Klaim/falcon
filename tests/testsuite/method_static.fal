* Falcon test suite

* ID: 21m
* Category: types
* Subcategory: classes
* Short: Static external call prevention.
* Description:
*    External functions always take for granted that the self object
*    is containing Falcon object. Calling a method directly from a
*    class causes the class to be passed as self, thus breaking this
*    convention.
