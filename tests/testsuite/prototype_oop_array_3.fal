* Short: Prototype indirect arrays
* Description:
*  Checking OOP indirect operations on array based prototyped objects.
*
*  In 0.8.x version, VM has a special code used to complie string expansion
*  and indirect operators which mimics the full compiler, but is much more
*  compact and faster. However, this duplicates code, at least in
*  functionalities, and that must be tested separately for arrays and
*  dictionary bindings.
