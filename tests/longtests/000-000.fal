This is the test for the long - test system. 

Some test require to run for a long time before they can declared passed.
This extensions to the test system allow to declare partial advancement
in tests which are accounted separately.

This command initializes the long test system and declares
how many checkpoints are expected to be met:
@long 25

Checkpoints are met by printing a line of text, or a specific 
text alone on a single line, indicated in the following command:
@checkpoint STEP

The following command is optional and indicates a timeout that each
step must meet in milliseconds, or the test will be declared failed:
@interval 500

The @result and @output commands work like in the normal test mode.
We'll use @output in this test. 

The output text INCLUDES the checkpoint text; this is because, in tests
with many checkpoints, removing the checkpoint text from a correct output
run can be tedious.
