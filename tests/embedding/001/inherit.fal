// Testing inheritance:

class NewPoint(x,y,z) from Point(x,y)
	z = z
	
	function describe()
		return @"NewPoint (${self.x}, ${self.y}, ${self.z})"
	end	
end

p0 = Point(3,4)
p1 = NewPoint( 2,3, 4)

> p0.describe()
> p1.describe()

// as you can see, distance() method will get the base C structure in Point
> "old-styled distance: ", p0.distance(p1)
