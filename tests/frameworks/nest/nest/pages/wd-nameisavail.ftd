<h2>Nest Widget test: NameIsAvail</h2>

<p>Names taken on the server are: <?
   namewid = Nest.widget( "TheNameIsAvail" )()
   > ", ".merge( namewid.takenNames )
?>
</p>
<p>Please, notice that the names must be at least <?= namewid.minSize ?> characters long.</p>
<p>Check for availability: <?= namewid.render() ?></p>

<p>This is a test of the NameIsAvail widget, which can be subclassed to specify
a precise AJAX behavior. The site has a "TheNameIsAvail" subclass that emulates
a small DB.</p>
