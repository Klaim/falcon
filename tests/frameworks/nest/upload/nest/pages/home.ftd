<h1>Upload service test</h1>
<p>The Nest Upload service allows to upload and manage files for insertion in blogs, wikis and so on.</p>
<p>It is meant to be used in popup windows or CSS/javascript windows and works as a minimalistic remote
file manager.</p>
<p>As one of its main, but not exclusive functions is that of selecting a file from the list for
insertion in a text area, we show here this feature.</p>
Open the uploader service <a href="javascript:utest()">clicking here</a>.
</p>
<p>
<? Nest.service( "WikiTextBox" ).render() ?>
</p>

<h2>Problems with javascript?</h2>
<p>Then you can use <a href="<?= Nest.pageLink("upage") ?>">this link</a> for a simple test.</p>
