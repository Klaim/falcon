<h1>Falcon Nest; External site definition test.</h1>
<p>This site structure is similar to the "menu" test, but here all the nest-related pages,
configurations and extensions are placed outside the scope of the application entry point.</p>
<p>When possible, the site structure should be designed so that all the security-sensible
informations are simply not reachable through the web server.</p>

<? login = Nest.ambient( "auth_data" ).value ?>
<? if login ?>
   <p>You are currently logged in as <?= login ?>.</p>
<? else ?>
   <p>You are <b>not</b> currently logged in</p>
<? end ?>
