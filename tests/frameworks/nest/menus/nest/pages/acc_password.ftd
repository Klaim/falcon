<h1>Change password</h1>
<p>Sorry, this is only a test, and we're not using a database.</p>
<p>So, in short, this is just a fake page</p>
<p>On the other hand, this page installs a plugin service, called MenuService,
that should appare in the plugin page.</p>
<p>The new item is a link to an external password strenght checker. Useful, isn't it?</p>
