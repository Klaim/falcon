/** The Core Module.
 
 This module contains the standard functions that are usually available to scripts.
 
 The functions in this module are still a little above language-level (or builtin)
 functions, which are resolved immediately at compiler level and are provided by
 the engine.

 In this way, embedding applications can chose to create other versions of
 the core module, or removing it altogether, without the need to re-introduce
 very basic and language-bound functions. In fact, while functions like printl
 may be completely out of context in an embedded script having to drive an
 application, max(), int() and toString() are definitely  part of the language
 standard and should always be present as pre-defined.
