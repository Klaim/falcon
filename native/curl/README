BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

To build falcon-curl you need:

   - The CMake buid system (http://www.cmake.org/)
   - Development files of the Falcon programming language.
   - Development fiels of the libCURL project.
   - A compiler/IDE compatible with CMake.

  Once unpacked the files, create a "build" directory where you prefer.
We'll suppose you create it below the topmost path of the source package.

  Then, enter the build directory and launch

  $ cmake <source dir> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

  Where <source dir> is the relative or absolute path to the directory
where this file you're reading resides.

  On POSIX systems, you may find useful to add the option -DCMAKE_BUILD_PREFIX
to specify where the module should be finally installed.

  Please, refer to Falcon module generic build instructions for more 
sophisticated options. 

  Refer to CMake online guide to specify the directories where libcurl
may be installed.
