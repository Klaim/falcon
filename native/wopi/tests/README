                          Falcon WOPI - Test site


   This test site contains a small web-based application that can run
through the various WOPI front-ends.

   Although WOPI is largely seamless, you'll need to configure the various
WOPI modules to point to this area, or to configure you web server to read
this directory as a CGI or FastCGI directory.

   Also, you may be required to configure the web application essential
data, as the sessions timeout or the location where to place temporary
files, either changing the configuration parameters in the WOPI specific
front-end configuration files or setting them as "wopi_" attributes in
the index.fal file.

   Also, in case of using CGI or FastCGI front ends, remember to copy the
binary CGI front end in the directory, and name it "index", "index.exe"
or "index.cgi" depending on the operating system you're on. Also, the file
copied file should be directly executable.

   In case you use the cgi_fm frontend, remember to make index.fal
executable, if your system allows to, and to correctly configure the sh-bang
directive at top of the file to point to the falcon command line interpreter.
