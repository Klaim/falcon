CHANGES
=======

  The internal version of PCRE is obtained by properly configuring
pcre with UTF8 support and CR policy = ANY as a static library.
  
  Then, the pcre.h file is manually modified to remove the extern "C"
block surrounding all the declarations; this makes internally 
generated names mangled as C++ symbols and makes them unique.

  Also, all the "extern" declarations are removed (otherwise
elf loader may be invited to search the symbols in the loading
applications); this requires to change PCRE_EXP_DEFN macro
in front of global variables in pcre.h to a proper different
macro. This to make those variable extern, but to allow
functions not to be declared as extern.
