	Dear Reader,

     First of all, thanks for considering using The Falcon Language for
   Your job, or to embed it into Your application, or to use it for any
   other reason. This file contains the Falcon Programming Language License,
   which explains what You are allowed to do with Falcon and what You are
   supposed (and allowed) not to do. Since the legal jargon may be cryptic,
   You are provided here with a little resume of the License. It is important
   that You read and accept the License, as this resume hasn't any legal
   valence, and is provided only for the reason to express clarifications and
   examples that cannot find their place in the formal document.

     The License grants You the rights to use the Source code of Falcon and
   its various components in any way; You can study it, You can copy it,
   You can modify it, and You can even sell it, but You can't change the
   license under which it is distributed: even if You sell it, You have to
   provide the customers with the source code of Falcon and to grant them the
   same rights You have on it.

   The License also grants Your copyrights and intellectual rights for any
   modification or addition You may want to apply to Falcon. In case or
   addition and modifications, the License binds You to provide the user
   with the information that the original program, that is Falcon, was
   modified by You and what are the changes or the additions that You applied.

     Also, even if You can freely distribute, or even charge a fee, for Your
   derived work, You MUST apply the Falcon Programming Language License to
   Your modifications, and distribute them under the same terms. In other
   words, Your modifications, if made public, must be provided or available
   in source code.

     The license also grants You the right to embed Falcon in any application.
   Here You are granted the right to pick the terms and licenses You prefer,
   and to distribute Your embedding application without providing its source
   code. Even if significant portions of Falcon are in line functions, and even
   if You decide to statically link Falcon in Your application, this doesn't
   make it a "Derivative Work" of it: Your Embedding application is free to
   embed Falcon "as is" as it wish, without any requirements in terms of
   source distribution. You can also modify Falcon for Your specific needs and
   THEN embed Your modified version; the modified version of Falcon is under
   Falcon License, and must be made available in source code (or be proposed
   as a Contribution to the Falcon Committee), but Your Embedding application
   can still be distributed under Your preferred terms. The License has only
   a requirement that is demanded on Your Embedding application: You HAVE to
   state somewhere (in a place that CAN possibly be seen by the average user)
   that You are embedding Falcon and the reason for that. In example, You may
   state "ProgramX uses the Falcon Programming Language to automate the
   Gamma procedure".

     About the scripts, which are more or less what a scripting language is
   for, You are granted the right to apply the license You prefer. As Falcon
   is also a script "compiler", You may even retain from distributing the
   script sources, and apply closed-source license to Your script-based
   application or to the scripts that are embedded in Your embedding
   application. However, if You don't distribute the script sources, You are
   again required to state somewhere in Your documentation or where
   the user can read it that You are using "Falcon", and more or less why
   You are doing it. For a pure Falcon application, You can just state
   "This application is written in Falcon". In example, if You use Falcon
   to drive a web site, and You don't want Your site visitors to ever see
   Your scripts, You have to put somewhere a reading like "Powered with
   Falcon"; doesn't have to be a n-inch banner on Your home page, You may
   also have just a small reading in a secondary page.

     What You cannot do is to claim that any thing You learnt from Falcon
   is Yours: especially, You are forbidden to patent any element that is
   found in Falcon. Another thing that You can't do is to sell a Falcon
   based product as if it were "completely" Yours, forgetting to cite, even
   in a very small reading, the fact that Falcon is in. Finally, a thing
   that the License prevents You from doing is to put the blame for failures
   on Falcon: the product is provided as-is, without any warranty. It's up
   to You to test if it is suitable to solve Your problems, and if a Falcon
   based application can be sold and granted as "working" to Your customers.
   If that application breaks, whether there's a problem with Falcon or not,
   You can't issue any claim on the Falcon contributors.


     Be kind on the Open Source Community: they have already made a lot
   for Your even if You don't know them (and even if they don't know You).

         Best regards,

      Giancarlo Niccolai

      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution of Work and Derivative Works. You may reproduce and

           of this License, or the application of another License is

           available to the Users in any medium and by any means, the
           portions of the Source form that causes the Work to be embedded
           must carry a prominent notice about this fact, along with a general
           statement about the task that the Work is performing in the
           Embedded Works; and

       (d) If the Source form of Scripts is not distributed nor made
           available by any mean to the Users, a prominent notice about the
           fact that the Scripts have been written in the Language must be
           presented in a place which the Users are exposed to.

   6. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement You may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   7. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   8. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   9. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,

      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   10.Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of Your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
