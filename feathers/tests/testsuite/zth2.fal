/****************************************************************************
* Falcon test suite
*
* ID: 51d
* Category: threading
* Subcategory:
* Short: Runtime re-creation (1)
* Description:
*    The threading module must create a vm similar to the original one
*    when starting a new thread. To do that, it creates a new runtime
*    filling it with the modules coming from the calling VM, and links
*    it in a new VM.
*
*    This test checks that dependency from core and from threading is
*    correctly restacked. It consists of two scripts, with names at the
*    opposite spectrum of the module map, so that if correct order is not
*    granted, a link error will arise.
*
*    In this first test, the name of the calling module is the highest.
