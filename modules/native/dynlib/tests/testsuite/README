                     DynLib - Dynamic Library Loader for Falcon

                               Automated test suite

  This test suite works as usual with faltest. All the tests in this directory
require the test_dynlib.xxx (where xxx is your platform DLL/so/dylib extension)
to be created and copied manually here or installed.

  To build test_dynlib.xxx from test_dynlib.c, use -DWITH_TESTS=ON from cmake
command line. Install targets generated by cmake will copy the resulting binary
dynamic library into this directory, but if you don't want to run the install
targets, just copy it manually.
