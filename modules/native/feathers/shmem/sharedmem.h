/** Shared memory abstraction.
   This class allows a closed, black-box shared memory area to exchange data between
   Falcon applications.

   The data in the shared memory cannot be accessed directly by the applications. Instead,
   it must be read or written atomically to some process-specific memory, and then
   accessed from there. Even if generating extra reads and writes at each
   passage, this method avoids that programming errors in one application (which may
   be a script) block the others.

   The local memory where the shared memory must be copied is accessed in form
   of a Stream. The stream interface is extremely efficient for memory based operation,
   and has already all the needed policies for dynamic memory management, and read-write
   size recording.

   The shared memory can be backed on a system file or just be created transient.
