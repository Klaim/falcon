                    Web Oriented Programming Interface

                                  1.3



Falcon Web Oriented Programming Interface is a suite of modules providing
a coherent programming interface for web development across different means
to publish web applications, for example web server modules, CGI, FastCGI
and so on.


Contents
========

   WOPI is currently providing the following front ends:

   - CGI standalone embedding application: a binary application meant to
      load falcon scripts and serve them through a CGI interface.
   - Fast-CGI standalone embedding application: a binary application interfacing
      Fast-CGI libraries.
   - CGI Falcon module: A module that can be loaded (or pushed) into executable
      scripts that delivers the WOPI interface to them.
   - Apache2 web server module: A loadable module for Apache2 that allows to serve
      dynamic web pages from Falcon scripts directly.
   - Standalone web server: A minimal web server that can be used to distribute
      static content or execute Falcon scripts. 

Build instructions
==================

To build this module, you'll need

   - Falcon development files, version >= 0.9.6
   - CMAKE

To build the Apache2 WOPI module, you'll need also:
   - APR-1 with pkg-config installed.
   - Apache2 development files.

For FastCGI module, you'll need also:
   - FastCGI development files

To build the various modules, you need to instruct CMAKE with the proper
configuration switch, -D<switch>=ON. The switches are namely:

   - BUILD_FALCGI 
   - BUILD_CGI_FM 
   - BUILD_FFALCGI
   - BUILD_FALHTTPD
   - BUILD_MOD_FALCON

NOTE: Apache include files are often installed in uncommon places. If they
are not under a standard include directory (/usr/local/include or /usr/include),
you may need to add the CMAKE option

   -DAPACHE_REAL_INCLUDE_DIR=<path to apache includes>

If you have faldoc documentation tool installed on your system, you may
also consider to create the documentation as an HTML site enabling the
following:

   - CREATE_DOCS
