NATIVE modules

This directory contains important falcon modules that are not considered
standard language parts (as Feathers) but are nevertheless important and
to be distributed with Falcon where possible and applicable.

The install destination on target system is the default falcon modules
destination, although some of the native modules may be installed in
non-root parts of the falcon module hierarcy (i.e. net.*, web.* and so on).

Some of the native modules may require special requirements on the target
system to be succesfully installed, or build and install also helper
applications, framework elements, documentation and other items that
are not "falcon modules", strictly speaking.

Please, refer to the documentation and to the README files of each single
module to have more information on each element.
