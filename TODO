Open issues at 0.8.12
   * Streams, mainly file streams, are still to be buffered and optimized.
     If Falcon is employed for high throughput applications, as i.e.
     grepping files, writing massive log amounts, copying files, applicative
     data buffering should be used, and raw write/read stream methods on
     large strings or MemBuf data types should be employed for
     better performance.

   * Stream API may undergo some reshaping during 0.8.12->0.9 step.

   * Assembler has some issues; it is being moved to a stand-alone
     application and library (and possibly to a separate project)
     in 0.9, so it known problems are not being fixed now. The
     assembler is not functional to a correct Falcon application,
     so its status is irrilevant at current development stage.

Missing before 0.9

    * Specialization of FBOM per type.
    * Contracts.
    * 3d party DLL support.
    * Virtual file system support.
    * Advanced script debug support.
    * The conio (advanced console I/O) module.
    * The Falcon Abstract Toolkit (FAT), with GTK driver.
    * CGI support module.
    * Internet protocols (http, ftp, smtp, imap ecc.) modules.
    * Mail module.
    * The language reference.
    * The developer (contributor) guide with doxygen generated API reference.
