MISCELLANEOUS:
   * Unit tests including "dbi standard" test that will test
     required functionality from all drivers
   * Organize the dbi_status listings so that they are in
     some type of logical order. Right now I just keep
     appending to the end as I see the need for a new one
     thus they are in a very erradic order.

OBJECT PERSISTENCE:
   * Object persistence needs to be rethought. Many potential problems
     have appeared along the way. I am going to leave it as is but
     perform a study on how this should actually look/function.
   * Could not determine how to store a static class variable, so I made
     a dangerous global DBIHandle variable in C++ that needs to be
     changed right away.
   
DRIVERS:
   * firebird/interbase driver
   * mssql driver
