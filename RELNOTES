                                 Condor Release

                                    0.8.11-10


  Condor release closes the overall language structure extension and completes
the paradigms supported by falcon adding prototype based OOP and tabular
programming.

  The functional programming paradingm has been greatly extended through the
introduction of late bindings and the addition of more functional-oriented
operators in the the funcext feather module.

  Functionally, late bindings are variables declared in sequences which
assume values as the evaluation proceeds. They are declared through the "&"
opeartor, and

  Paradigms are now more formalized and the overall stability of the engine
and of the language has sensibly grown. Be sure to read carefully the
ChangeLog in this version, as many aspects of the grammar has been changed.

  Current package is a bleeding edge verison released to test build and
installation issues on supported platforms.
