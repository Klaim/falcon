                       RELNOTES for Falcon 0.8.8

   This is a bugfix version of Falcon 0.8.6; also, the limitation of the VM
in unloading modules in arbitrary order has been removed, and the ability to
load modules using virtual partitioned names (as i.e. load a.b.c) has been
added.

   The version has been also given some functions that are useful for the
completion of the 0.8 series.
