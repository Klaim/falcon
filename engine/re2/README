This is a modification of the RE2 library modified to work as
an embedded component of the Falcon Programming Language.

Files that are not necessary for a dry build and functions that
are not necessary for the integration in the language mechanics
have been removed.

Other modifications have been performed to make the library
understand the native Falcon::String data type.

The original RE2 library is distributed under a BSD-style license.

Original boiler plates, LICENSE and copyright related files are
preserved.

Here follows the contents of the original README file:
