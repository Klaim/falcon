                         Falcon Development Tools

                                   0.8

  The tools in this directory are meant to be a support for development of
third party modules and embedding applications. Some are also used during the
distribution and packaging.

  Modules and embeddings that are not included in the Falcon Source Project
are not bound to use Falcon Development Environment. They just require a standard
installation of Falcon with development support (dev packages for debian distros,
Development option turned on for windows installer and so on), which will include
correctly configured tools which are present in this part of the project.
