/** Falcon Garbage collector.

 @section coll_loop Collection mark-sweep loop thread.
 The mark-sweep loop has the follwing structure:
 - The items currently locked are marked.
 - The live modules are makred.
 - The VMs registered with this collector are scanned for live items to be marked.
 - The sweep loop reapes all the items that fall beyond the last live VM generation.
 - The new items are marked with the CURRENT generation, and moved in the normal garbage.
 - The generation is advanced.

   Items may be locked by active threads right after the first step, but they are
   allocated in the new item list; so, they cannot be reaped during the current loop.

 @section coll_trace History tracing

 The garbage collector provides a powerful debug feature called "history tracing".

 History tracing traces any operation performed by the GC on any pointer passed
 to it as a DeepData pointer, in particular creation, marking and destruction.
 The report includes taking timings and perform consistency checks. For instance,
 if the GC tries to create a pointer over another pointer that is not yet free,
 or if it tries to mark a pointer that has been already deleted, the program
 dies immediately tracing all the needed information via Engine::die.

 The tracing is useful not just to expose bugs in Falcon GC and engine memory
 management, but also to fix bugs generated by modules and embedding applications
 during the early development stages.

 For instance, suppose that an application misbehaves and destroys a DeepData
 that has ben delegated to Falcon. Then, the whole program will crash later on,
 when the GC tries to mark or destroy it; but using a C++ debugging device or
 an appropriate crash error handler, it is possible to get the history of the
 pointer that has caused the error and see where and when it was created, and
 approximately up to when it was still valid.

 Normally, history tracing is compiled in debug builds and disabled in
 release builds, but it is possible to
 compile it in release enabling the compilation option FALCON_TRACE_GC. Once
 compiled-in, the trace option can be enabled and disabled at any time. When
 disabled, it has just a small marginal cost with respect to the trace-free
 version, so it can stay compiled into any non time-critical application to
 be available for activation in case a deep diagniostic is needed.

 The history tracing is transparently enabled on any store() operator,
 using the FALCON_GC_STORE macro, which will be directed to the H_store operation
 when FALCON_TRACE_GC is enabled at compile-time. Then, to enable tracing the activity
 of the GC at runtime, the trace() method must be called.

 At that point, the tracing process becomes transparent.

 To get information about a single data pointer passed to the GC use the method
 getHistory(), while the whole status can be dumped using either dumpHistory() or
 enumerateHistory().

 \note The trace events are never removed until the the collector is destroyed,
 or until clearTrace() is explicitly called. This might cause an exponential
 growth in memory usage in large programs. Either be sure to periodically
 call clearTrace() or consider using traceMark() method to disable the tracing
 of GC mark calls.
