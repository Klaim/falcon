/** Collection of (static) modules active in a virtual machine.
 
 The module place is a place where modules reside and possibly share their
 data through the standard import-export directives.
 
 Steps to get a module ready to run:

 # add() (optional) predefined modules not needing to be resolved.
 # resolve() - resolves all the dependencies eventually loading what's needed.
 # link() - publishes exports resolves imports from each module
 # apply() - stores the main methods of each module in the VM in proper order.
 
 Then just run the VM.
 
 The process can be repeated more than once for the same ModSpace, calling
 add() and/or resolve() multiple times before each link() and apply(). Also,
 link() can be called multiple times before apply(). 
 
 This step functions will operate only if there is actually something to do for
 them. For instance, adding a module that is already present won't have any 
 effect; calling link() will just resolve the newly pending dependencies that
 have been introduced since last call; calling apply() will add to the VM
 just the __main__ functions of the newly read modules since last apply()
 was called and so on.
 
 Children ModSpaces can be used to put inside them an insolated set of modules.
 They will look into parent modules for already resolved modules and as a place
 where to copy public symbols.
 
 \note Explicit compilation requests (via compile from scratch and include())
 might create a new module space that might be eventually linked with the module
 space of the module where the compilation takes place. This relationship
 allows to decide whether the compilation is dynamic, static or partial.
 # If the module is added to the loading/compiling module space, every module
   included by the loaded module is also stored in that ModSpace.
 # If the moduled is added to a new ModSpace which has the loaders module as
   a parent ModSpace, existing modules can be used by the loaded one, but other
   modules needed by the loaded one are loaded anew and added to the new space.
 # If the module is added to a new ModSpace without any parent, the module is
   practically living in a separate space and needs to load anew any dependency
   (including the Core Module).

    \param module The module to be added.

    This method is mainly thought to add a module that has been
    created by a third party application in a module space, for
    it to be usable by new code incoming later on.

    If the same identical module is present (by address), the method returns
    false. As multiple modules having the same logical name should not exist in
    the same space, the incoming module will automatically receive a different
    unique name (schemed after "modname-X", where X is an incremental number).
    If this is not desirable, check the result of getModuleByName() method
    before trying to add the module.
    
    The module exported symbols are
    imported in the module space. This might throw an "already defined" error.
    In this case, the error is thrown after the module is already added to the
    module space.

    \note add() is actually store() + forced export.
