/** Standard Falcon Execution unit and library.

 Falcon modules are used to transiently store code and data that can then
 be executed by a virtual machine (usually, a single virtual machine, and just once).

 The contents of modules is dynamic in the sense that it might be altered at
 any stage of their lifetime.

 Modules can be linked in a virtual machine statically or dynamically.
 
 Static modules have a lifetime that is meant to be longer than that of the
 virtual machine they are attached to. They are injected into the virtual machine
 externally and cannot be explicitly referenced or unloaded by the owning VM.

 Dynamic modules can be loaded and unloaded multiple times during the lifetime
 of their own VM.
 
 The main difference between the two type of modules is that dynamic modules need
 to create entities that might survive their own lifetime, and that need to be
 accounted separately for garbage reclaim.
 
 The advantage of statically link a module is that all the items it declares
 are outside the scope of garbage collection. This has two effects: first,
 a program declaring linking a module statically doesn't need
 any special care about preventing that module to be destroyed by the garbage
 collector, and stays in control of its lifespan. Second, the garbage
 collector is not required to perform useless checks on the items declared by
 the module (mainly functions and classes), that will be considered always
 valid.

 The kind of a module is not stored in the module structure itself. Instead,
 it's the link process that determines if a module should be considered static
 or dynamic. Notice that the link process @b modifies the contents of the module
 and it's not possible to link the same module twice (but it is possible to clone
 a "model" module dispatching its clone for linkage any number of time).

 \note Function and Class have support to gc-mark the modueles they come
 from, so that dynamic modules that might be unloaded by the virtual machine
 at system process level stay alive as long as there is at least one function or
 class getting CPU code directly from their memory space. SynFunction class owns 
 its syntactic tree and reference global variables, so they don't need to back-mark 
 their module -- however, they do because of meta-information held in the module
 (module logical name, URI, attributes etc).
 
 \note Modules whose source is uncertain should be always deleted through the
 unload() method. See the method description for more information.
