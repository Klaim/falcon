    This function renders the timestamp using a format that is similar to that of the POSIX strftime applied on
    C time stamp structures.

    Falcon doesn't support C locale functions natively (they are provided through a separate module), but
    internationalization is supported in this function through Process::setTranslation() system.

   The following conversion specifications are supported:

    - %a: Replaced by the locale's abbreviated weekday name. By default, it's English 3 character names,
          that can be overridden by setting the translations for "Mon","Tue", "Wed","Thu","Fri","Sat","Sun".
    - %A: Replaced by the locale's full weekday name. By default, it's English day names, that can be overridden
          by setting the translations for "Monday","Tuesday", "Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday","Sunday".
    - %b: Replaced by the locale's abbreviated month name. By default, it's English 3 characters month names,
            that can be overridden by setting the translations for
            "Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May","Jun","Jul","Aug", "Sep","Oct","Nov","Dec".
    - %B: Replaced by the locale's full month name. By default, it's English month names,
            that can be overridden by setting the translations for
            "January","February","March","April","May","June","July","August", "September","October","November","December".
    - %c: Replaced by the locale's appropriate date and time representation.
          By default, it's "%a %b %d %T %Y", but can be overridden by setting the "#TimeStamp::datetime" name.
    - %C: Replaced by the year divided by 100 and truncated to an integer, as a decimal number [00,99].
    - %d: Replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number [01,31]. [ tm_mday]
    - %D: Equivalent to "%m/%d/%y".
    - %e: Replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number [1,31]; a single digit is preceded by a space.
    - %F: Equivalent to "%Y-%m-%d" (the ISO 8601:2000 standard date format).
    - %g: Replaced by the last 2 digits of the week-based year (see below) as a decimal number [00,99].
    - %G: Replaced by the week-based year (see below) as a decimal number (for example, 1977).
    - %h: Equivalent to %b.
    - %H: Replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number [00,23].
    - %I: Replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number [01,12].
    - %j: Replaced by the day of the year as a decimal number [001,366].
    - %m: Replaced by the month as a decimal number [01,12].
    - %M: Replaced by the minute as a decimal number [00,59].
    - %n: Replaced by a <newline>.
    - %p: Replaced by the locale's equivalent of either a.m. or p.m. Defaults to "AM" and "PM", and can be
          overridden by setting the translations for "#TimeStamp::AM" and "#TimeStamp::PM"
    - %r: Replaced by the time in a.m. and p.m. notation; by default, it's equivalent to "%I:%M:%S %p",
          but can be overridden by setting the transation for "#TimeStamp::12h".
    - %R: Replaced by the time in 24-hour notation "%H:%M".
    - %S: Replaced by the second as a decimal number [00,60].
    - %t: Replaced by a <tab>.
    - %T: Replaced by the time ( %H : %M : %S ). [ tm_hour, tm_min, tm_sec]
    - %u: Replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [1,7], with 1 representing Monday.
    - %U: Replaced by the week number of the year as a decimal number [00,53]. The first Sunday of January is the
          first day of week 1; days in the new year before this are in week 0.
    - %V: Replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number [01,53].
          If the week containing 1 January has four or more days in the new year, then it is considered week 1.
          Otherwise, it is the last week of the previous year, and the next week is week 1.
          Both January 4th and the first Thursday of January are always in week 1.
    - %w: Replaced by the weekday as a decimal number [0,6], with 0 representing Sunday.
    - %W: Replaced by the week number of the year as a decimal number [00,53].
          The first Monday of January is the first day of week 1; days in the new year before this are in week 0.
    - %x: Replaced by the locale's appropriate date representation. By default, it's "%Y-%m-%d", but it can be
          overridden by setting the translation for "#TimeStamp::date_format".
    - %X: Replaced by the locale's appropriate time representation. By default, it's "%H:%M:%S", but it can be
          overridden by setting the translation for "#TimeStamp::time_format".
    - %y: Replaced by the last two digits of the year as a decimal number [00,99].
    - %Y: Replaced by the year as a decimal number (for example, 1997).
    - %z: Replaced by the offset from UTC in the ISO 8601:2000 standard format ( +hhmm or -hhmm ),
          or by no characters if no timezone is determinable. For example, "-0430" means 4 hours 30 minutes
          behind UTC (west of Greenwich).
    - %Z: Replaced by the timezone name or abbreviation, or by no bytes if no timezone information exists.
    - %%: Replaced by %.

    Some of the formats can be specifically translated using the 'E' and 'O' type specifiers
    - E  Uses the locale's alternative representation %Ec %EC %Ex %EX %Ey %EY. It's actually ignored.
    - O  Uses the locale's alternative numeric symbols  %Od %Oe %OH %OI %Om %OM %OS %Ou %OU %OV %Ow %OW %Oy
         To set locale symbols for the ciphers in place of the arabic cypers, use set the translation
          "#TimeStamp::N", where N is 0 to 9;

    Falcon also provides the following extension with respect to the standard formats:
    - %i: Replaced by the international RFC2822 representation (HTTP and MIME headers format).
    - %q: Replaced by the milliseconds, not padded.
    - %Q: Replaced by the milliseconds, padded with zero, in range [000-999].
