/** Syntactic tree.
 *
 * The syntactic tree is actually a list of PStep, that may be either
 * (standalone) expressions or statements, which may hold other syntactic
 * sub-trees.
 *
 * The syntactic tree is a PStep on itself. This means that can be seen
 * as a PCode that is directly executed by the virtual machine.
 *
 * The effect of executing a Syntree (that is, calling its apply() methid)
 * is that of calling the perform() method on all the PStep it holds, in sequence.
 *
 * \note None of the methods in this class is guarded. Accessing any invalid
 * item outside 0..size() will cause crash.
