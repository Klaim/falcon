/** Closure abstraction.
 
 A closure is a pair of a function and closed data. Closed data is data
 referenced by the function, but coming from the outside.
 
 ClassClosure allows to interact with the closure at script level and to invoke 
 it.
 
 Closures are automatically generated by the ExprClosure espression, which
 takes a function and closes the data externally referenced by it. The parser
 generates an ExprClosure around a function definition if it has some external
 symbol reference (in the partent trees; not in the global context). 
 
 Closure items are consider immediately callable.
