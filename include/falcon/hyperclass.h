/** Class holding more user-type classes.

 Hyperclasses are a common skeleton for classes formed by the union of
 exactly one child (the master class) and all its parents. At engine level,
 the HyperClass appare like the "child" class empowered with the methods and
 properties from the parent.

 As the nature of the child and the parents is transparent to a hyperclass,
 classes of any kind can be used to create an hyperclass. However, as the
 hyperclass must know in advance the properties offered by all the classes,
 subclasses that provide a varying set of properties are not served correctly
 by hyperclasses. Those varying classes aren't usually suited to form a rigid
 hierarchy as the one represented by HyperClass, and are usually left alone
 (as they already provide polimorphic abilities and can be shaped on the
 need of the moment, obviating the need of inheritance).

 \note Hyperclasses don't offer any mechanism to support forward definition
 of parents. The final child class and the parent classes must be known
 by the time the hyperclass is formed.

 The instance created by the hyperclass is actually a plain item array, where
 each element is the "self" seen by each class. Altough a bit sub-optimal
 in some cases, this helps to transparently hold Falcon item types as subclasses,
 and simplifies garbage collecting management in case some subclass requires
 the generated self instance not to be marked.

    This version of the constructor can be used to synthezise a hyperclass

    then possible to directly add parents to this hyperclass. This helps to
