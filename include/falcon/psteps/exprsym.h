/** Expression referring to a symbol.
 
 These expressions have the role to access a symbol in read
 or write (lvalue) mode in an expression.
 
 Initially, when first created in an expression, the ExprSymbol
 MAY refer just the name of the symbol that should be referenced,
 so that the real symbol can be resolved at a later stage.
 
 The expressions will either hold a symbol coming from a container
 (a function or a module), or a dynamic symbol created from the script.
 
 In the former case, the symbol is simply referenced directly, without
 any marking, GC Locking or reference counting mechanism. This is because
 any element of a tree will end up in marking its container, where the
 symbol referenced by this expression is supposed to be. Also, trees cannot
 be unparented. This is achieved through the referenceFromContainer method.
 
 In the latter case, the expression should create a GC Lock to keep safe
 the dynamically created symbol as long as the expression, and the tree it is
 in, exists. This is achieved through the safeGuard method.
 
 Whenever a tree is cloned (which is the only way to move a tree away from
 its container), if an ExprSymbol is holding a symbol, it creates a new
 dynamic symbol resembling the old one, it stores it in the garbage collector
 and gives it to the cloned ExprSymbol via the referenceFromContainer
 method.
