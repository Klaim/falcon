    \param exc The Falcon::Error instance that was thrown.
    \return The same entity that is passed as parameter, so that
       it's possible to use it on the fly.

    This method is invoked by the virtual machine when it catches an Error*
    thrown by some part of the code. This exceptions are usually meant to be
    handled by a script, if possible, or forwarded to the system if the
    script can't manage it.

    If an handler is found, the stacks are unrolled and the execution of
    the error handler is prepared in the stack.

    If a finally block is found before an error handler can be found, the
    error is stored in that try-frame and the cleanup procedure is invoked
    by unrolling the stacks up to that point; a marker is left in the finalize
    pstep frame so that, after cleanup, the process can proceed.

    If a new error is thrown during a finalization, two things may happen: either
    it is handled by an handler inside the finalize process or it is not handled.
    If it is handled, then the error raising process continues. If it is not handled,
    the new error gets propagated as a sub-error of the old one. Example:

    @code
    try
      raise Error( 100, "Test Error" )
    finally
      raise Error( 101, "Test From Finally" )
    end
    @endcode

    In this case, the error 101 becomes a sub-error of error 100, and the
    error-catching procedure continues for error 100.

    If a non-error item is raised from finally, it becomes an sub-error of the
    main one as a "uncaught raised item" exception. If the non-error item was
    raised before an error or an item throw by finally, the non-error item is
    lost and the raising process continues with the item raised by the finally
    code.

    @note The method returns the same error it receives; in this way, it is
    possible to create the error directly via new statement as the
    parameter and have it back. Notice that the error gets a reference increment
    when it's sent to raiseError(), so it is necessary to dereference it
    when the caller doesn't need it anymore.

    The extension code can call directly raiseError() whenever it's going
    to return the control to the calling Falcon::Processor as soon as possible.
    When raiseError() returns, this context may have significantly changed,
    but if calling code is able to yield the control back to the Falcon system,
    this might save a useless C++ throw. However, when the code detects an error
    deep down in C++, it should simply throw it and let the Falcon::Processor
    main loop to catch it.

    \note Invoking this method causes exiting from any critical section, that is
    releasing (and signaling) any acquired resource.
