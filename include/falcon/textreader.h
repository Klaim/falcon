/** Class providing the ability to read data from a text oriented stream.
 
    This class is meant to read text into strings. It uses a text decoder
 to transform raw data input into characters under a given encoding.

   Input is buffered autonomously by the Reader hierarcy; this means that using
 a buffered stream is sub-optimal, as the text encoding reader has its own
 buffering strategy.

 \note As the buffering policy is reader-specific, a stream delegated to a reader
 cannot be used atonomously after it is being used here. However, it is possible
 to re-delegate the same stream to another reader, maintaning its status and
 pre-read buffers, to change the way it is accessed.

 A typical pattern usage of a text reader is that of scanning a network stream
 for HTTP-like headers, and then turn into a raw data reader to get all the
 incoming data. This can be performed through the following pattern:

 @code
 SocketStream s( ... ); // intialize the stream -- can be stack owned.
 TextReader headReader( &s );

 int clength = 0;
 // ... read the heder lines lines ...
 String header;
 while (  headReader.readline( header ) && header != "" )
 {
    //... parse the headers ...
 }

 if ( clength )
 {
 DataReader contentReader;
 headReader.delegate( contentReader );
 buffer = new byte[clength];
 contentReader.read( buffer, clength );
 }
 // ...

 @endcode

 \note TextReader methods never enlarge the character size of the string, which
   is automatically enlarged when the first character that would not fit in the
   current character size is met. Is performance is to be preferred to space constraint,
   it is wiser to provide a String whose character size has been enlarged to the maximum
   size that the desired text encoding may support.

    This method fills a string with all the contents of a text file.

    The algorithm stores the target text in smaller pre-allocated strings,
    merging them after the full size and character width of the final string
    is known. This makes relatively efficient to read very large text files, but
    it requires an extra amount of temporary memory to perform the operation.

            characters had been read before hitting and end-of-line.
    \throw EncodingError if the input stream has encoding errors.

    This method scans a stream in search for a LF, CRLF or LFCR sequence
    (whichever comes first). If maxCount characters are read before finding
    such a sequence, the method returns false, but the read contents are stored
    in the target string.

    The string is re-allocated and resized as needed.

    The end-of-line sequence is NOT returned in the target string.

    To loop on all the lines of the lines in a file, the following strategy
    can be adopted:

    \code
    String tgt;
    Reader reader( ... );

    while( true ) {
      if ( ! reader.readLine( tgt, 1024 ) )
      {
         // either we're eof, or the line was longer than 1024 characters.
         if ( tgt.size() == 0 ) {
            break; // we're eof
         }

         // manage unterminated line, possibly raise an error
      }
      else
      {

         // manage a line
      }
    }
