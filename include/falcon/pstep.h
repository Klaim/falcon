/** Common interface to VM processing step.
 *
 * This is the common base class for statements, expressions and statement sequences,
 * which are the basic components of the Virtual Machine code processing.
 *
 * These are the 3 basic elements that can be processed by the virtual machine.
 * The VM scans its code stack, calling the apply() method of the topmost element.
 * When a sequence "apply" is invoked, it starts calling the perform() method of all its
 * members; they can be performed on the spot, acting immediately on the virtual machine,
 * or push themselves in the code stack and return the control to the calling VM.
 *

 *
 * Expressions can be also processed by statements that can call their eval() member directly.

   /** Apply function. 
    \param self The PStep that was applied here.
    \param ctx The virtual machine context where this apply function was run
    
    This is the callback function that the virtual machine will invoke when
    this step is found in the code stack. As such, the step being called via
    the apply function is \b granted to be on top of the code stack of the
    \b ctx it receives.
    
    \note the apply function is called exclusively by a Virtual Machine or 
    Virtual Machine Context related operation on the top item in the code
    stack.
    
    The function could be called also by a composite PStep. For instance,
    it can be called by a parent expression or by a SynTree, which is a 
    collection of special subclasses of PStep (more specifically, a collection
    of Statement instances).
    
    The composite PStep will check if the called sub-steps have changed the
    code stack, and in case they did, it will yield the control to its caller.
    
    The pattern for composite step is as follows:
    @code
    // I am at top of VMContext
    while not done
       get next substep
       call next substep apply by pushing it in the context
       Am I still at top of the VMcontext? -- if not, return
    end
    pop myself from VMContext.
    @endcocde
    
    There are two ways to check if the VMContext has been changed. It is possible
    to check if the topmost code frame is changed,
    @code
    CodeFrame& topCode = ctx->currentCode(); // yep, that's me
    doSomething();
    if( &topCode != &ctx->currentCode() ) 
       return;
    ctx->popCode(); // remove me.
    @endcode
    
    Although fast, this method is subject to false positive in case the code
    in doSomething pushed something in the stack but then removed it, as the
    stack might have been invalidated in the meanwhile.
    
    However, this is hardly a problem as the stack soon stabilizes to a size
    accomodating the program depth, and the code must be designed to properly
    be resumed after returning. However, if this causes some problem, or if 
    arranging for return is slower than peforming a little more complex check,
    this second pattern can be used:
    
    @code
    long depth = ctx->codeSize();
    doSomething();
    if( ctx->wentDeepSized( depth ) ) 
       return;
    @endcode
    
    The check is slower (this requires some pointer math) but avoids
    false postives.
