/** Compilation context for Falcon source file compiler (ABC).

 The compilation context is meant to keep track of the progress of the compilation
 process, and also provide extended information about what is being compiled.

 For example, it keeps track of the syntax tree being formed, and of the current
 depth in nested structures being parsed.

 Also, it is notified about new items being created by the grammar rules; for
 example, it is responsible to create new symbols that are then inserted in the
 syntax tree being constructed.

 Notice that this is a base abastract class, as the actual behavior excited by
 the invocation of new items depends on the compilation targets: the Virtual Machine,
 the interactive mode or a Module. The subclasses may create the structures for a
 later review (i.e. extern symbols in modules), or interrupt the parser to
 prompt the user for new data (the interactive compiler).
